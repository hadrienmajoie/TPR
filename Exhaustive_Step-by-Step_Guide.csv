Step,Description
1. Environment Setup,Install required dependencies and drivers for ROCm. Remove conflicting NVIDIA drivers.
2. Cloning Projects from GitHub,"Clone ROCm, TensorFlow, CodeGeeX repositories under ./Projects/ using git clone commands."
3. Compilation of ROCm from Source,Compile ROCm from source by following the official ROCm documentation. Ensure all GPU hardware is supported.
4. Compilation of TensorFlow from Source,Compile TensorFlow from source with ROCm support. Use custom configurations to optimize GPU usage.
5. Compilation of CodeGeeX from Source,Compile CodeGeeX from source. Ensure the model is optimized for use with ROCm and TensorFlow integrations.
6. Configuration and Integration of Geekcodex CLI,Set up and configure geekcodex CLI for managing build processes and dependencies across all components.
7. Optimizing TensorFlow for ROCm,Optimize TensorFlow and CodeGeeX to work seamlessly with ROCm using custom flags and environment settings.
8. Verifying the System Configuration,Verify all drivers and dependencies are correctly installed. Check for compatibility across components.
9. Testing GPU Functionality with ROCm,Run test scripts to verify GPU functionality with ROCm. Benchmark the system performance.
10. Code Push to GitHub,Push the project code to GitHub. Ensure version control is properly set up for the entire project.
11. Starting the Tomographic Passive Radar Project,Begin structuring and writing code for the tomographic passive radar system using TensorFlow and CodeGeeX.
12. Running Initial Tests and Benchmarks,"Run initial tests and benchmarks on the radar project. Verify output, accuracy, and system performance."
