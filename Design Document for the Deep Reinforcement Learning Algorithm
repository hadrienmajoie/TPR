## Overview

This document outlines the design of a Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) algorithm that will be trained on hyperspectral signature data. The goal of the DRL algorithm is to optimize the analysis of hyperspectral data, enabling accurate classification, anomaly detection, and material recognition.

## Key Components of the DRL Algorithm

### 1. **Environment**
The environment consists of the hyperspectral signature databases that represent real-world materials. The environment is dynamic as it evolves based on the interaction between the agent (DRL) and the data.

### 2. **States**
Each state represents the current set of hyperspectral bands being analyzed. The state space is defined by the features extracted from the hyperspectral images, including spectral bands, spatial resolution, and other image metadata.

### 3. **Actions**
Actions represent the possible operations that the DRL agent can take to process the hyperspectral data. These include:
- Feature selection (choosing relevant hyperspectral bands for analysis)
- Data transformation (applying image processing algorithms, such as smoothing or segmentation)
- Classification decisions (predicting the material class for each pixel)

### 4. **Reward Function**
The reward function will guide the learning process by providing feedback to the agent. Rewards will be given based on the following criteria:
- **Accuracy of classification**: Higher rewards for correct material classifications based on hyperspectral data.
- **Minimization of false positives**: Penalizing incorrect classifications to encourage the agent to improve.
- **Efficiency**: Rewarding faster and more efficient processing, ensuring that the DRL algorithm can handle large-scale data in real time.

### 5. **Training Process**
- The DRL agent will interact with the hyperspectral datasets by performing classification and processing tasks. 
- The agent will update its knowledge based on the rewards it receives and adjust its actions accordingly.
- The training process will involve a large set of real-world hyperspectral signatures, allowing the DRL model to generalize well to unseen data.

### 6. **Hyperspectral Signature Databases**
The training data will be sourced from public hyperspectral signature databases that contain spectral signatures of materials across a wide range of wavelengths.

## Next Steps
- Fork and clone public hyperspectral signature datasets.
- Define the specific algorithms and techniques to be used for deep reinforcement learning (Q-learning, policy gradient methods, etc.).
- Develop the DRL model and begin testing with small subsets of hyperspectral data.
