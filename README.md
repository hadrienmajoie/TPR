# Project Overview

## Directories and Scripts Overview
- **blah2/**: Custom directory for [specific purpose].
- **CodeGeeX/**: Contains [specific scripts or data].
- **heimdall_daq_fw/**: Contains firmware development scripts and resources.
- **kfr/**: Used for [description of kfr directory].
- **krakensdr_doa/**: [Description of krakensdr_doa directory].
- **krakensdr_pr/**: Main directory for the Krakensdr project.
  - `install_krakensdr_pr.sh`: Installation script for Krakensdr.
  - `krakensdr_dev_setup.sh`: Development setup script for Krakensdr.
  - `update_kraken_web_interface.sh`: Updates the Kraken web interface.
- **librtlsdr/**: [Description of librtlsdr].
- **radare2_src/**: [Description of radare2_src].
- **tools/**: Contains custom tools like `install_dev_tools.sh`.
- **signalhound/**: Contains scripts related to Signalhound projects.

## Project Goals and Methodology
- **Objective**: To organize and integrate all custom scripts related to Krakensdr, Heimdall DAQ, and Signalhound into one coherent workflow using Git for version control.
- **Plan**: 
  1. Organize all scripts into relevant directories.
  2. Set up Git for version control and use GitHub Copilot for auto-suggestions.
  3. Document the process and version scripts based on functionality updates.
  
## Versioning Plan
- **Initial Version**: Basic organization and functionality review of all scripts.
- **Future Versions**: 
  - Integrate GitHub Copilot for auto-suggestions.
  - Ensure each script has a detailed comment section explaining its purpose.
  
## Next Steps
- [List any next steps you'd like to take].

## Hyperspectral Passive Tomographic Radar (HSPTR) Publication

We have published a foundational document detailing the integration of base-60 quaternions, Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKP), and plasma dynamics for advanced electromagnetic systems. The practical application of these concepts is demonstrated through the Hyperspectral Passive Tomographic Radar (HSPTR) system.

This document serves as both a theoretical framework and a practical demonstration within the broader TPR project. You can access the publication [here](./HSPTR).

### Key Highlights:
- Introduction of base-60 quaternions for precise control of electromagnetic fields.
- Use of ZKP to mitigate Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle in quantum systems.
- Practical demonstration through HSPTR for cybernetics and electronic warfare applications.

### Future Work:
We invite contributions, feedback, and discussions to further enhance the development of these concepts. The next steps involve experimental validations and extended applications in radar and cryptography.
